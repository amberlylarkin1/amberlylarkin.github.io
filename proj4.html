			<h3> I love to travel. This summer my best friend Michael and I took a road 
			trip to Moab, Lake Powell, and Las Vegas. We camped the whole time. It was
			the best time of my life. We saw so many cool places we would have never seen
			if we hadn't gone. In the picture below is Antelope Canyon. It's a canyon in
			Arizona right near Lake Powell. It's made up of beautiful red rocks. I hope to
			travel to many more places in the future because seeing and experiences new
			places is one of my favorite things ever. </h3>
