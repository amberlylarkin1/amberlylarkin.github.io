			<h3> Growing up fifteen minutes away from Red Rocks (the coolest concert venue 
			in the world) made it extremely easy for me to see shows. I've seen about 
			twenty concerts at Red Rocks. I love going to shows with my friends in the 
			summer. The atmosphere at Red Rocks is incredible. Everyone is so happy and
			nice. It's also the most beautiful place ever to see shows. The view of Red
			Rocks looks over the city of Denver and right as the show starts the sun goes
			down and the sunsets are always gorgeous. One of the things I miss most about
			Colorado is Red Rocks. </h3>
