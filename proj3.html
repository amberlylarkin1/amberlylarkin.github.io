			<h3> Growing up so close to the mountains made it super easy for me to ski. 
			I've been skiing my whole life. The first time I went skiing my grandparents 
			from Maine took me to Breckenridge when I was three years old. Ever since I've
			gotten an Epic Local pass ever winter. My friends and I always go skiing
			together. We usually hike to the best spots to get the best powder. We ski 
			down into the trees and set up our hammocks to take breaks. The rest of the
			day is spent skiing or on the chair lift. Ski days are the best and skiing
			will always be my passion. </h3>
