			<h3> I grew up in Littleton, Colorado my entire eighteen years of existence.
			I grew up fifteen minutes away from Red Rocks and about an hour and a half
			from the best ski mountains in the west. Growing up, the summers were spent 
			at Red Rocks seeing concerts and the winters were spent in the mountains 
			skiing. </h3>
			
			<h3> I went to Columbine High School all four years. It was the best community 
			I could have possibly grown up in. The impact that going to Columbine is 
			something I wouldn't trade for the world. The school was like a family. 
			I made the best friends in the world and they became my second 
			family. </h3>
